## 160001045 optimitasion project
In this project is on airline trafficking problem. The operations that affect this mostly is the handling of arriving and departing flights. The main focus is the detection and resolution of conflicts between the subset of flights in their zone. 

Aim is to show how the airport ground movement problem can be formulated as a minimum cost flow problem to which the network simplex algorithm can be applied. We are going to use the simplex into the network itself to get the optimal solution.
